          The book in the attached PDF is in six parts preceded by a Table of Contents and <a href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=7" class="page-number">Page 1</a> (the PDF page-numbering system will require the addition of 6 to any book-numbered page which is sought). <span class="page-number">Page 1</span> probably contains material of the most unprecedented nature of any other page in the book. Beyond <span class="page-number">Page 1</span>, Part 6, which gives history and background of the book's development, might be found to be its most readable section. Part 1 is readable up to a point; Part 2, I often find difficult or tedious to read myself, but it underlies much else in the book. Parts 3-5 are essentially sections on the complicated "How to do it" process to possibly eliminate disease and human maladies and for other reasons (see especially Text for Part 4, <a href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=107" class="page-number">Pages 101-115</a> and perhaps Text, <a href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=94" class="page-number">Page 88</a>.)

          I'm sending my book to a number of scientists whose books I've read. To them and anyone else interested I would mention that on <a href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=406" class="page-number">Page 400</a> there is a brief presentation of a possible basis for the 4 obvious dimensions through which we move, i.e. time and the 3 spatial dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, on <a href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=428" class="page-number">Page 422</a> is found an even briefer presentation of a basis for the expansion of our universe, and on <a href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=472" class="page-number">Page 466</a> is a proposal for the source of the fine-structure constant, often mentioned by physicists. As to another important constant, I have suspected the basis for the 120 odd-numbered pages of Part 4, beginning on <a href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=123" class="page-number">Page 117</a>, might very well have to do with the basis for the cosmological constant proposed by Einstein.

          Of greater interest to most will be reference to a possible source of some of the cancers which afflict humans with basic discussion in the vicinity of <a href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=471" class="page-number">Page 465</a> of Part 6, as well as mention of Alzheimer's on <a href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=475" class="page-number">Page 469</a>.

          I am officially copyrighting my book, hopefully to discourage against any human tendency to claim credit for ideas which might be valid and are first suggested in this work. Insofar as I have not given credit where due, I trust I will be corrected. My work has been done in a completely alone state with only some books as collaborators and a very occasional reference to the Web.
        </p>
        <p>
          Essentially, no one has ever read any of this work because I have found no one interested in the question, "Why are we here?" as based on my primary reason for asking the question and as based on the only source available to me to pursue an answer. The primary reason for my asking the question has been my conviction that until we have a factually known and verifiable answer to this question, there is to be no known ultimate usefulness to that with which I might concern myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only source available to me to pursue an answer to "Why are we here?" has been myself as the laboratory, initially suspecting that if I could determine the real relationships between all the parts of my body, then the edifice to which I would become privy would quite likely serve as a guide to the larger edifice, the universe of which it is a part.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Myself as the laboratory" will no doubt be viewed as an unreliable source, but it is what I have had, and I have listened to it for 25 years, creating innumerable iterations of the connections I was seeing until at last they all spoke in one voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most crucial summation of my 25-year effort to determine the relationship of my body parts to one another (bones, muscles, organs, glands, etc.) and draw some possible relationship of our bodies to the rest of the universe will be found on <span class="page-number">Page 1</span> of the PDF containing the book. It has been my hope that the radical nature of what is presented on <span class="page-number">Page 1</span> will pique enough interest to entice a further perusal of the work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I make myself vulnerable now by finally trying to share this work, but it is what I have to offer, and I hope to enlarge any conversations which have been held heretofore based on a desire to truly understand the workings of living creatures and to determine whether such an understanding will lead to understanding our universe. I hope my effort will at least be viewed kindly.
