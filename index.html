          The book in the attached PDF is in six parts preceded by a Table of Contents and <span class="page-number">Page 1</span>. As mentioned in the introductory email giving the link to my Website containing the PDF, <span class="page-number">Page 1</span> probably contains material of the most unprecedented nature of any other page in the book. Beyond <span class="page-number">Page 1</span>, Part 6 (beginning on <span class="page-number">Page 371</span>), which gives history and background of the book's development, will likely be the most accessible for a number of readers. Part 1 is readable up to a point; Part 2, I often find difficult to read myself, but it underlies much else in the book. Parts 3-5 are essentially sections on the complicated "How to do it" process to possibly eliminate disease and human maladies and for other reasons (see especially Text for Part 4, <span class="page-number">Pages 101-115</span> and perhaps Text, <span class="page-number">Page 88</span>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm sending my book to a number of scientists whose books I've read. To them and anyone else interested I would mention that on <span class="page-number">Page 400</span> there is a brief presentation of a possible basis for the 4 obvious dimensions through which we move, i.e. time and the 3 spatial dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, on <span class="page-number">Page 422</span> is found an even briefer presentation of a basis for the expansion of our universe, and on <span class="page-number">Page 466</span> is a proposal for the source of the fine-structure constant, often mentioned by physicists. As to another important constant, I have suspected the basis for the 120 odd-numbered pages of Part 4, beginning on <span class="page-number">Page 117</span>, might very well have to do with the basis for the cosmological constant proposed by Einstein.
        </p>
        <p>

          Of greater interest to most will be my references to the possible sources of some of the cancers which afflict humans with brief discussions in the vicinity of <span class="page-number">Page 465</span> of Part 6, as well as a mention of Alzheimer's on <span class="page-number">Page 469</span>.
        </p>

          I am officially copyrighting my book, hopefully to discourage against any human tendency to claim credit for ideas which might be valid and are first suggested in this work.  Insofar as I have not given credit where due, I trust I will be corrected. My work has been done in a completely alone state with only some books as collaborators and a very occasional reference to the Web.
        </p>

          Essentially, no one has ever read any of this work because I have found no one interested in the question, "Why are we here?" as based on the only source available to me to pursue an answer, that is, myself as the laboratory.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Myself as the laboratory" will no doubt be viewed as an unreliable source, but it is what I have had, and I have listened to it for 25 years, creating innumerable iterations of the connections I was seeing until at last they all spoke in one voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          I make myself very vulnerable now by finally trying to share this work, but it is what I have to offer, and I hope to enlarge any conversations which have been held heretofore based on a desire to truly understand the workings of living creatures and to determine whether such an understanding will lead to understanding our universe. I hope my effort will at least be viewed kindly.
