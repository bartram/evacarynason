  <title>Life: Reflections On what is is, how it developed/develops, how it processes to death (but possibly need not do so), what it tells about our universe | By Eva Cary Nason</title>

    The book in the attached PDF is in six parts preceded by a Table of Contents and Page 1. As mentioned in the introductory email giving the link to my Website containing the PDF, Page 1 probably contains material of the most unprecedented nature of any other page in the book. Beyond Page 1, Part 6, which gives history and background of the book's development, will likely be the most accessible for a number of readers. Part 1 is readable up to a point; Part 2, I often find difficult to read myself, but it underlies much else in the book. Parts 3-5 are essentially sections on the complicated "How to do it" process to possibly eliminate disease and human maladies and for other reasons (see Pages ___.)
    </p>

    I'm sending my book to a number of scientists whose books I've read. To them and anyone else interested I would mention that on Page ___ there is a brief presentation of a possible basis for the 4 obvious dimensions through which we move, i.e. time and the 3 spatial dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
    Also, on Page ___ is found an even briefer presentation of a basis for the expansion of our universe, and on Page ___ is a proposal for the source of the fine-structure constant, often mentioned by physicists. As to another important constant, I have suspected the basis for the 120 even-numbered pages of Part 4, beginning on Page ___, might very well have to do with the basis for the cosmological constant proposed by Einstein.
    </p>
    <p>
    Of greater interest to most will be my references to the possible sources of some of the cancers which afflict humans with brief discussions on Pages ___, as well as a mention of Alzheimer's on Page ___.
    </p>

    I am officially copyrighting my book, hopefully to discourage against any human tendency to claim credit for ideas which might be valid and are first suggested in this work. Insofar as I have not given credit where due, I trust I will be corrected. My work has been done in a completely alone state with only some books as collaborators and a very occasional reference to the Web.
    </p>
    <p>
    Essentially, no one has ever read any of this work because I have found no one interested in the question, "Why are we here?" as based on the only source available to me to pursue an answer, that is, myself as the laboratory.
    </p>
    <p>
    "Myself as the laboratory" will no doubt be viewed as an unreliable source, but it is what I have had, and I have listened to it for 25 years, creating innumerable iterations of the connections I was seeing until at last they all spoke in one voice.
    </p>
    <p>
    I make myself very vulnerable now by finally trying to share this work, but it is what I have to offer, and I hope to enlarge any conversations which have been held heretofore based on a desire to truly understand the workings of living creatures and to determine whether such an understanding will lead to understanding our universe. I hope my effort will at least be viewed kindly.
