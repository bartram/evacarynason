        The book in the attached Original PDF (that of the Condensed PDF being a
        47-page attempt to present the primary theories of the Original PDF) is
        in six parts preceded by a Table of Contents and
        <a href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=7" class="page-number"
          >Page 1</a
        >
        (the Original PDF page-numbering system will require the addition of 6
        to any book-numbered page which is sought).
        <span class="page-number">Page 1</span> probably contains material of
        the most unprecedented nature of any other page in the book. Beyond
        <span class="page-number">Page 1</span>, Part 6, which gives history and
        background of the book's development, might be found to be its most
        readable section. Part 1 is readable up to a point; Part 2, I often find
        difficult or tedious to read myself, but it underlies much else in the
        book. Parts 3-5 are essentially sections on the complicated "How to do
        it" process to possibly eliminate disease and human maladies and for
        other reasons (see especially Text for Part 4,
        <a
          href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=107"
          class="page-number"
          >Pages 101-115</a
        >
        and perhaps Text,
        <a
          href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=94"
          class="page-number"
          >Page 88</a
        >.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I would mention that on
        <a
          href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=406"
          class="page-number"
          >Page 400</a
        >
        there is a brief presentation of a possible basis for the 4 obvious
        dimensions through which we move, i.e. time and the 3 spatial
        dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, on
        <a
          href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=428"
          class="page-number"
          >Page 422</a
        >
        is found an even briefer presentation of a basis for the expansion of
        our universe, and on
        <a
          href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=472"
          class="page-number"
          >Page 466</a

        is a proposal for the source of the fine-structure constant, often
        mentioned by physicists. As to another important constant, I have
        suspected the basis for the 120 odd-numbered pages of Part 4, beginning
        on
        <a
          href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=123"
          class="page-number"
          >Page 117</a
        >, might very well have to do with the basis for the cosmological
        constant proposed by Einstein.

      <p>
        I would like to say my book makes reference to the possible source and
        remedy of some of the terrible diseases which afflict humans such as
        cancer and Alzheimer's, but there is only one brief reference to cancer
        on
        <a
          href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=471"
          class="page-number"
          >Page 465</a
        >
        and one to Alzheimer's on
        <a
          href="Eva%20Cary%20Nason%20Manuscript.pdf#page=475"
          class="page-number"
          >Page 469</a
        >. However, my very strong sense has been that the diseases afflicting
        us are the result of the misaligned, unbalanced functioning of our
        bodies. Therefore, insofar as there is veracity to the large daily
        system I have laid out for aligned, balanced bodily functioning, then I
        would propose that my entire book is a treatise on eliminating disease.

        I am officially copyrighting my book, hopefully to discourage against
        any human tendency to claim credit for ideas which might be valid and
        are first suggested in this work. Insofar as I have not given credit
        where due, I trust I will be corrected. My work has been done in a
        completely alone state with only some books as collaborators and a very
        occasional reference to the Web.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essentially, no one has ever read any of this work because I have found
        no one interested in the question, "Why are we here?" as based on my
        primary reason for asking the question and as based on the only source
        available to me to pursue an answer. The primary reason for my asking
        the question has been my conviction that until we have a factually known
        and verifiable answer to this question, there is to be no known ultimate
        usefulness to that with which I might concern myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only source available to me to pursue an answer to "Why are we
        here?" has been myself as the laboratory, initially suspecting that if I
        could determine the real relationships between all the parts of my body,
        then the edifice to which I would become privy would quite likely serve
        as a guide to the larger edifice, the universe of which it is a part.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Myself as the laboratory" will no doubt be viewed as an unreliable
        source, but it is what I have had, and I have listened to it for 25
        years, creating innumerable iterations of the connections I was seeing
        until at last they all spoke in one voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most crucial summation of my 25-year effort to determine the
        relationship of my body parts to one another (bones, muscles, organs,
        glands, etc.) and draw some possible relationship of our bodies to the
        rest of the universe will be found on
        <span class="page-number">Page 1</span> of the PDF containing the book.
        It has been my hope that the radical nature of what is presented on
        <span class="page-number">Page 1</span> will pique enough interest to
        entice a further perusal of the work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I make myself vulnerable now by finally trying to share this work, but
        it is what I have to offer, and I hope to enlarge any conversations
        which have been held heretofore based on a desire to truly understand
        the workings of living creatures and to determine whether such an
        understanding will lead to understanding our universe. I hope my effort
        will at least be viewed kindly.
